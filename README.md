# Subensemble acceptance method

## Description

This repository contains material related to a subensemble acceptance method (SAM).
The SAM is a procedure to evaluate cumulants of distribution of globally conserved charges in a subvolume of a thermal system.

The SAM was initially developed for a case of single conserved charge in

The SAM was extended for the case of multiple charges in
- V. Vovchenko, R. Poberezhnyuk, V. Koch, *Cumulants of multiple conserved charges and global conservation laws*, [arXiv:2007.XXXXX [hep-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.XXXXX)

## Contents

- A Wolfram Mathematica notebook [**CumulantExpressionsFinal.nb**](CumulantExpressionsFinal.nb) allows to express an arbitrary cumulant of conserved charges up to sixth order in terms of the grand-canonical susceptibilities and acceptance parameter $\alpha$. The final expressions are written using the notation commonly employed in QCD literature.

## Attribution

Publications using the SAM formalism for multiple conserved charges should include references to the two SAM papers listed above.
